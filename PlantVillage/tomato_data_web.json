    "description": "Tomato is an herbaceous annual in the family Solanaceae grown for its edible fruit. The plant can be erect with short stems or vine-like with long, spreading stems. The stems are covered in coarse hairs and the leaves are arranged spirally. The tomato plant produces yellow flowers, which can develop into a cyme of 3–12, and usually, a round fruit (berry) that is fleshy, smoothed skin, and can be red, pink, purple, brown, orange, or yellow in color. The tomato plant can grow 0.7–2 m (2.3–6.6 ft) in height and as an annual, is harvested after only one growing season. Tomato may also be referred to as the love apple and originates from South America. Tomatoes are native to South and Central America, but they are now grown all over the world. Tomatoes are one of Africa's most widely grown vegetable crops. They are grown for home consumption in almost every homestead's backyard across Sub-Saharan Africa. They are a good source of vitamins as well as a cash crop for smallholders and medium-scale commercial farmers. Tomatoes used as flavor enhancers in food are always in high demand, both fresh and processed. Crop Details Scientific Name:Lycopersicon esculentum Common Name: Nyanya (Swahili) Inyanya (luhya)",

      "content": "Basic Requirements For high yield and premium quality, tomatoes prefer a relatively cool, dry climate. It is, however, adaptable to a wide range of climatic conditions. Tomatoes have been grown as far north (under protection) as the Arctic Circle and as far south as the hot and humid equator. Temperatures between 21 and 24°C are ideal for growth and development. Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 12°C can result in chilling. Temperatures above 27°C have a negative impact on growth and fruit set. Pollen and egg cells are destroyed when the maximum daytime temperature is 38°C or higher for 5 to 10 days. Fruit set is also generally poor when night temperatures exceed 21°C just before and after flower formation. Flower abortion can also be caused by hot, dry winds. Tomatoes are not affected by day length and can produce fruit in photoperiods ranging from 7 to 19 hours. Tomatoes can be grown in a variety of soil types, from sandy loam to clay-loam soils rich in organic matter. The ideal pH range for soil is 6 to 6.5; higher or lower pH can result in mineral deficiencies or toxicities. Flooding for extended periods is harmful to tomato growth and development. Growing from Seed Tomatoes can be direct-seeded or transplanted in the field, but this method is costly because large amounts of seed are required (about 500 to 1000 g of seeds/ha) and four weeks of weeding labor is added to the growing costs. Growing young transplants in a special nursery, on the other hand, allows growers to achieve high seedling uniformity while using less seed and saving money on weeding. Nursery bed preparation: General Care and Maintenance Tomatoes respond well to liberal applications of well-rotted compost or manure. A spoonful (or three teaspoons) of rock phosphate should also be added to each planting hole. If the soil is deficient in organic matter, it is best to grow a crop of high-quality green manure like cowpeas, mucuna, soybeans, or crotalaria before transplanting tomato seedlings. Avoid commercial nitrogen fertilizers because too much nitrogen causes fruit puffiness and blossom-end rot, as well as excessive vegetative growth. Excess free nitrogen in the soil softens the leaves and makes the plants more appealing to pests and diseases. Weed competition can be fierce, especially in the hot and humid tropics. Slash emerging weeds as close to the ground as possible between rows of tomatoes to control weeds on open land crops. Leave slashed weeds as mulch on the soil to help prevent erosion, lower soil temperature, and conserve soil moisture. This should be supplemented by manual weeding in rows and straw mulching of the beds. For tall growing indeterminate varieties, firmly plant a 2 m stake in the ground for each tomato plant and loosely tie the stems as the plant grows. Alternatively, place a sturdy pole in the ground every four meters and run two wires - one at 2 meters and another at 0.15 meters above the ground. Connect the two wires behind each tomato plant with a fairly strong string. As the plants grow, they can be carefully twisted around the strings. For indeterminate tomato varieties, pruning is required. On a weekly basis, one or two main stems should be allowed to grow and the side branches (laterals) should be pinched off as the crop grows. When 6 to 8 flower clusters form, the growing top should be pinched off to promote the development of large marketable fruit. Remove any leaves that are close to the ground to help prevent blight infection. On determinate cultivars, there is no pruning and no regulation of fruit number and clusters. Semi-determinate cultivars can be grown as both a determinate and an indeterminate crop. To avoid spreading tobacco mosaic virus disease, smokers should thoroughly wash their hands with soap before handling tomato plants.Tomatoes require adequate irrigation during the early stages of plant growth, fruit set, and fruit enlargement. The consistency of water supply to the plants is critical in achieving uniform maturity. It also reduces the occurrence of blossom-end rot, a physiological disorder caused by a lack of calcium during fruit enlargement. Watering is required at least twice a week in dry weather. Because it does not cause water splashes on the plants, drip irrigation is the most efficient and risk-free method of irrigation. Although indeterminate, cherry tomatoes can produce quite well even when not staked in the field, but they must be given adequate space because they spread quite widely (one m2 per plant is recommended). Higher output and easier field management are advantages of the costly staking procedure. Harvesting Before being marketed, fresh-market tomatoes are frequently harvested at the mature-green stage and ripened in transit or storage. Ethylene is sometimes used to quickly and uniformly ripen mature-green tomatoes before shipping them to market, but this has a negative impact on quality. In Kenya, this is not a common practice. Pre-ripe tomatoes are generally of lower quality (lower soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and reducing sugars) than plant-ripened tomatoes. Fresh-market tomato cultivars' growth and ripening patterns necessitate frequent pickings for either mature-green or plant-ripe fruits. Processing tomatoes, as opposed to fresh market or table tomatoes, are picked fully ripe. Harvesting is often done by machine in developed countries. Tomatoes used in pureed products such as soup, juice, and sauces are grown until more than 85% of the fruits are ripe. Those for whole tomatoes are picked while still firm, but only about 65% of the crop may be ready at once. To prepare tomatoes for market, store them in a shady location, either in the field or at home, after picking. The marketable fruits are then packaged in appropriate containers, which are typically 20-kg wooden boxes, bamboo baskets, plastic boxes, or other locally available packaging materials. Proper packaging protects the fruits and reduces water loss. Tomato storage life is determined by the maturity stage at which they are harvested as well as the desired fruit quality. Quality is highest when fully ripe, whether artificially or naturally. To ripen properly, mature-green tomatoes should be stored for 7 to 10 days at 13 to 18°C and 85 to 90% RH. The single most important visual parameter of tomato quality is color. Lycopene development is generally poor at temperatures above 30°C. This is the primary reason that tomatoes grown in the hot tropics have a pale red or yellowish color and are bland in flavor. Cherry tomato harvesting and packaging are determined by market demand. Fruit clusters can be cut for distant markets when the fruits turn red or pink, depending on the cultivar. For the domestic market, firm red ripe fruits are required. However, cherry tomatoes for the export market are graded and packaged into pre-packs before being shipped directly to supermarkets in the export destinations. A marketable yield of 20 tons/ha or higher is considered a good yield. Under experimental conditions at KALRO, Thika Horticultural Research Station, yields of up to 60 tons/ha have been obtained. When harvesting tomatoes for seed, pick ripe fruit from only robust, disease-free plants (plants free of bacterial canker, bacterial speck, bacterial spot, anthracnose fruit rot, early blight, late blight, and tomato mosaic virus). Wash the fruit, preferably with a potassium-based soap, to reduce the risk of disease infection. Cut the fruit in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Alternatively, squeeze the pieces into a clean bucket, plastic, glass, or ceramic bowl until only the seed-jelly and fruit sap remain. Cover the bowl with a cloth or paper to keep dirt and other contaminants out, but don't make it airtight. Allow the seeds to sit for 1 to 5 days (usually 2 to 3 days in warm areas). If seeds cannot be sown right away, they should be stored in a waterproof container (transparent plastic bag / clear glass bottle). Transparent materials allow sunlight in, reducing mould growth. Put some ashes in the bottom of the container to absorb moisture and keep the seeds from moulding. When storing seeds in pots or bottles, the tops should be covered with plastic film to prevent water seepage and mite infestation. Keep the seed container in a cool, dry location. Check the seeds for mould development on a regular (at least weekly) basis. If mould is found, the seeds should be dried again. Seeds can be stored for up to two years if properly dried. One kg of tomatoes produces between 1 and 4 grams of seeds.",

Later the insect spread to Spain (2006), France, Italy, Greece, Malta, Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Turkey in following years. Further the insect has been identified in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman and the rest of the Gulf states. In Africa it spreads from Egypt to Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (in East) and to Senegal and Nigeria through the west. (It spread through infested fruits and packaging materials) Life cycle: Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 12 generations per year. Yield loss: If unchecked, insect will cause 100% yield loss. The larvae feeds on apical buds, tender new leaflets, flowers, and green fruits which make it a serious pest in tomato. Host Range: This insect also attacks other solanaceous crops like potato, eggplant, pepino and tobacco. It is also reported on many solanaceous weeds.",
        "management": "ManagementLeafminer natural enemies normally keep populations under control; check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest if making new plantings in same place or close by; keep the field free from weeds especially Solanum, Datura, Nicotiana; use pheromone traps and white sticky traps to monitor and control insect;only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies.",

        "symptoms": "The characteristic symptom of root knot nematodes is the presence of galls on roots which can be up to 3.3 cm (1 in) in diameter but are usually smaller; galls cause a reduction in plant vigor; if the galls on the roots are extensive then plants may yellow and wilt, particularly in hot weather.",
        "cause": "Nematode",
        "comments": "Galls can appear as quickly as a month prior to planting; nematodes prefer sandy soils and damage in areas of field or garden with this type of soil is most likely; disease can be a major problem if soils are infected with Meloidogyne sp. and resistant varieties are not used for production.",
        "management": "ManagementPlant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil ;check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes; solarizing soil can reduce nematode populations in the soil and levels of inoculum of many other pathogens.",
