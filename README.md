A simple yet powerful Python script to scrape comprehensive plant information, including diseases and pests, from the [PlantVillage](https://plantvillage.psu.edu/) website. The data is saved locally as a structured JSON file, perfect for agricultural data analysis, research, or building a plant care application.

- **Pest Guide**: Gathers information on various pests, including their scientific names and management strategies.
- **Image Links**: Collects URLs for images related to the plant, its diseases, and pests.
- **Structured Output**: Saves all scraped data into a clean, well-organized JSON file for easy use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests bs4
```
